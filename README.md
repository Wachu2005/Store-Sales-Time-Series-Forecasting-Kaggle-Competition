Goal of this Competition was to show the impact of diffrent features on sales to decrease food waste related to overstocking and improve customer satisfaction in  chain of grocery stores. I did data analysis and explained the data in simple way to se which features corelate the most, the I created diffrent model checked their performence with root of mean_squared_log_error. Simple Neural Network performed the best so i choose it to make predictions.
